            <h2 class="sub-h3">What do we do?</h2>
            <p class="sub-text">We’re waging war on the standardized eyewear market with our unique 
                product lines designed to aid both people with colorblindness as well as people with 
                reading difficulties. <br> We combat reading difficulties by using smart technology that 
                read words aloud which enhances comprehension. <br> We’ve securely triumphed over colorblindness 
                by adapting and improving our own custom glasses with enhanced color contrast. </p><hr>

    <div class="product-box2" id="b">
        <h2 class="sub-h3">What is our mission?</h2>
        <p class="sub-text">Visual Technology’s mission is to decrease the struggles of 
            those who are visually impaired. <br> Our team is working towards a bright future 
            where one pair of glasses satisfy all customer needs. </p><hr>

    <h2 class="sub-h3">Our upcoming product</h2>
    <p class="sub-text">Our next project, IC glasses 1.0, is set to revolutionize what humans 
        expect out of everyday eyewear. <br> We’ve embarked on a quest to fuse our two product lines 
        together into one all-purpose pair of glasses. This 2-in-1 special combination aims to 
        diminish people’s glasses collection into one all-encompassing pair. </p>
