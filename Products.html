            <img src="Photos/produkt1.jpg" alt="image1">
            <p><br>Since the company name is ISee Technology, we agreed that we had to give the product a name associated with the company. The glasses contain technology that with the help of a transmitter (Bluetooth) do various functions, which gave us the idea of the product name, Visual Blue 1.0. We consider this a good name as we got influence by the company name and technology in the glasses included. The blue color included in the logo and the website also makes this appropriate.</p>
            <p><br>The product is a pair of glasses that are constructed to contain different technology’s (Eye-tracking, camera, colorblind filter). Glasses with gadgets on top of them all functioning to give the user an easier daily life. Smart glasses exist on the market today. Companies like “Vuzix”, “Lenovo”, “Epson” and “Xiaomi” with models like “Vuzix M300”, “Microsoft” “Epson Moverio BT-300”, “Lenovo ThinkReality A6“ and “Xiaomi Smart Glasses” are trying to implement functions like digital display, sound, gps and 3D view.
                The “Visual Blue 1.0” has the unique combination that makes our product well suited for people with various visual impairments. While some companies include some function, none of the industries contain glasses with these many functions together. (Wikitude, 2021)

            <h2>Eye-tracking</h2>
            <img src="Photos/produkt2.png" alt="image1">
            <p><br>Eye-tracking is the technology that, with the help of a surface, will be able to follow eye movements. On the surface, infrared light rays are used, which give reflections in the eye, and further calculate data from the user's eye movements. A lot of the already working mechanics on the market and the one we use can fire an infrared light instead of a visible light at your eyes. The light is shown in a specific pattern which lands on your eye making it easier for the infra-red cameras built into the tracker to keep tabs on changes and how the light is being reflected. Many times, per second the camera will take infra-red snapshots of the patterns on your eyes and process these images to determine where you’re looking. </p>
            <p><br>TThis can provide information about what the user is focusing on (Tobii Tech, 2021). The Eye-tracking technology becomes one of the basic elements of the glasses and assists other functions, such as the camera functions. (Tobii Tech, u.d.), (Tobiidynavox., u.d.)

            <img src="Photos/produkt4.png" alt="image3">
            <p>The camera is located on the front of the glasses. This helps the user to take pictures of everyday situations, and together with eye-tracking provides good user experiences. What the user is looking at, the camera will also emphasize.</p>
            <p>On the left side of the glasses, there is a focus function that acts as progressive glass. It is an autofocus camera that operates by analyzing an image and once it has been projected onto one or more sensor it adjusts the focus based on the qualities help it to determine subject distance or clarity. There is also a zoom slider on the left side of the glasses that is used to digitally zoom on objects.  This is good for those with myopia, as progressive glass corrects vision at multiple distances simultaneously. The focus function can therefore be used as a camera or binoculars, to focus on selected areas. There is also a camera button on top of the glasses, which makes it easier to take good pictures and to improve usability. (HealthLine, 2018) (Mister Spex, u.d.) (Wikipedia, 2021)</p>
