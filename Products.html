            <p><br>The glasses are constructed to contain a various assortment of different technologies. These technologies work cohesively to create a piece of eyewear with immense accessibility.

            <h2 class="sub-header">Eye-tracking</h2>
            <img src="Photos/produkt2.png" alt="image1">
            <p><br>Eye-tracking uses infrared light rays which reflects upon the eye and calculates the data from its movement patterns. This technology serves as a foundational element to implement other functionality.</p>

            <h2 class="sub-header">Camera functions and focus:</h2>
            <img src="Photos/produkt3.png" alt="image3"> 
            <p><br>The camera is located on the front of the glasses. This helps the user to take pictures of everyday situations, and together with eye-tracking provides good user experiences. What the user is looking at, the camera will also emphasize.</p>
            <p><br>On the left side of the glasses, there is a focus function that acts as progressive glass. It is an autofocus camera that operates by analyzing an image and once it has been projected onto one or more sensor it adjusts the focus based on the qualities help it to determine subject distance or clarity. There is also a zoom slider on the left side of the glasses that is used to digitally zoom on objects.  This is good for those with myopia, as progressive glass corrects vision at multiple distances simultaneously. The focus function can therefore be used as a camera or binoculars, to focus on selected areas. There is also a camera button on top of the glasses, which makes it easier to take good pictures and to improve usability.</p>

            <h2 class="sub-header">Color filter:</h2>
            <img src="Photos/produkt4.png" alt="image3">
            <p><br>The glasses contain a thin filter that is a part of the glass. Their function is to enhance the vibrancy and saturation of colors. A filter is trying to solve the cones overlapping. The filter does this because a colorblind person has a misfunction on the cones in their eyes, the photoreceptors that detect color. The filter is a multi-notch filter. It is embedded with rare earth metals that absorb certain wavelengths of light, leaving just the wavelengths that a colorblind personâ€™s eyes have an easier time distinguishing. This means that the filter on the glasses will enchant the red and green colors, making it easier to distinguish between them
