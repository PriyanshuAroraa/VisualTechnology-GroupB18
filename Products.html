            <img src="Photos/produkt2.png" alt="image1">
            <p><br>Eye-tracking uses infrared light rays which reflects upon the eye and calculates the data from its movement patterns. This technology serves as a foundational element to implement other functionality.</p>

            <img src="Photos/produkt3.png" alt="image3"> 
            <p><br>To capture still images of what the +/- buttons is looking at, a camera situated at the front works in tandem with the eye-tracking. The glasses will then process the image-text and read it back to the user through speakers.</p>
            <p><br>The focus button located on the left side functions like progressive glasses. It analyzes the scene through sensors which adjusts clarity. The buttons allows the user to digitally zoom in on objects.</p>

            <h2 class="sub-header">Color filter:</h2>
            <img src="Photos/produkt4.png" alt="image3">
            <p><br>The glasses contain a thin filter that is a part of the glass. Their function is to enhance the vibrancy and saturation of colors. A filter is trying to solve the cones overlapping. The filter does this because a colorblind person has a misfunction on the cones in their eyes, the photoreceptors that detect color. The filter is a multi-notch filter. It is embedded with rare earth metals that absorb certain wavelengths of light, leaving just the wavelengths that a colorblind person’s eyes have an easier time distinguishing. This means that the filter on the glasses will enchant the red and green colors, making it easier to distinguish between them
